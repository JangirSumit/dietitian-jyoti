            <h5>Corona Virus (Covid-19) Is Pandemic Now</h5>
            <p>As per the WHO: Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the
              common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute
              Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed
              investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary
              camels to humans. Most coronaviruses spread the same way other cold-causing viruses do: through infected
              people coughing and sneezing, by touching an infected person's hands or face, or by touching things such
              as doorknobs that infected people have touched.</p>

            <h5>Protect Yourself From Kidney Stone
            </h5>
            <p>Renal stones can be found in kidneys, ureter, urinary bladder, or urethra. These are formed when the
              urine becomes too concentrated with certain components which results in crystallization of these
              components. Crystals in urine stick together to form a hard mass of stone referred to as crystals.
              The majority of urinary calculi (renal stone) are made up of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, uric
              acid, or magnesium ammonium phosphate(struvite). Most common type in India is calcium oxalate. Recurrence
              of kidney stones is common.</p>
            <h6>Symptoms:</h6><span>
              <ol>
                <li>Pain areas: in the back or side part of the body</li>
                <li> Pain types: can be severe, sharp, or sudden in the abdomen</li>
                <li> Pain circumstances: can occur during urination</li>
                <li> Gastrointestinal: nausea or vomiting</li>
                <li> Urinary: blood in the urine or frequent urination</li>
              </ol>
            </span>
            <span>
              <h6>CAUSES:</h6>
              <ol>
                <li>There are many reasons behind renal stones but most important is dehydration or LACK OF INTAKE OF
                  FLUIDS on a daily basis.
                </li>
                <li> Overconsumption of foods rich in oxalates, (like spinach, wheat bran, mustard leaves, tomato sauce,
                  peanuts, soybean, cocoa, coffee, cashew nuts) increases the risk of reoccurrence of calcium oxalate
                  stones.
                </li>
                <li>Excess salt intake is also the main reason behind kidney stones. Table salt (sodium chloride) is a
                  rich source of sodium and is a major contributing factor in the formation of kidney stones.
                </li>
                <li>High sodium intake increases the risk of stone formation by increasing calcium levels and decreasing
                  citrate (a stone inhibitor) levels in urine. These altered levels make it easier for stones to
                  develop.
                </li>
                <li> Higher intake of animal food like meat, fish, and poultry increases the risk of renal calculi as
                  animal protein increases the acid load of urine.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </span>
            <span>
              <h6>DO’S AND DON’TS</h6>
              <ol>
                <li>Restriction of animal protein like red meat, fish, sausages, beef, poultry products lessens the risk
                  of renal stones.
                </li>
                <li>Salt Restriction: Daily salt intake should be reduced (less than 4 gms per day)in order to prevent
                  reformation of kidney stones. Foods like canned food, salad dressings, biscuits, sausages, beverages
                  should be avoided as these are high in sodium content.
                </li>
                <li>Plenty of fluids is a great idea: like coconut water, lemon juice, barley water, vegetable soup,
                  etc.</li>
